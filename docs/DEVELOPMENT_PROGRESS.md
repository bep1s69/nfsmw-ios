# Development progress and session handoff

This is the entry point for continuing the battery work. Update the current
checkpoint and append meaningful observations, changes, tests, failures and
decisions as work proceeds. Do not rely on chat history or temporary files as
the only record. Keep measured results separate from hypotheses, including
negative or inconclusive results. Record the exact build, arguments, settings,
input paths, test commands, outcomes and next action for each experiment.

## Read first

- [Technical history and evidence](TECHNICAL.md): architecture, SDK patches,
  chronological experiment records, measurements, test limitations and build IDs.
  Old "pending" paragraphs are historical; use this checkpoint for current state.
- [Backlog](BACKLOG.md): parked iPhone loading issue, pipeline archive persistence
  and GPU capture. Do not reopen those during battery work unless requested or
  the issue recurs.
- `../HANDOFF_CHATGPT.md`: the original October 15 architecture/history handoff,
  present locally but intentionally untracked. Do not overwrite or stage it.
- Previous battery investigations, before repeating an experiment:
  `/Users/bep1s/Desktop/debug/14 October 2026/BATTERY_FINDINGS.md` and
  `/Users/bep1s/Desktop/debug/14 October 2026/BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION.md`.

## Working rules

- Work locally on `battery-optimization`; do not push, publish, tag or release
  without explicit permission. Local commits are authorized.
- Preserve Stefan Stoica's existing Git author configuration; add no attribution
  lines. Do not commit game assets, generated game code, logs, traces or IPAs.
- Investigate and explain new source changes before implementation; obtain the
  user's approval. The fused upload-sizing experiment below is approved.
- Preserve default visual fidelity, stability and functionality. Quality
  reductions belong only in optional Battery mode or its settings.
- Make isolated changes. Validate on device before stacking another source
  change. Small experiments get short correctness runs; accumulate them for
  meaningful power comparisons rather than demanding repeated tiny race A/Bs.
- Preserve user-owned and pre-existing changes, especially the heavily patched
  sibling SDK. No SDK source edits are required for the current experiment.
- Persist observations and results in Markdown as explicitly requested on
  October 18, including inconclusive/failed tests and pending device validation.

## Workspace and build

Main repository: `/Users/bep1s/Documents/GitHub/nfsmw-ios`.
SDK: `/Users/bep1s/Documents/GitHub/rexglue-sdk-ios`, also on the battery branch,
with extensive pre-existing local platform patches and submodule changes.
The Android reference repository is the sibling `NFSMW-Recompiled-Mobile`.

Build from the main repository's `ios` directory:

```sh
cmake --build --preset ios --target ipa -j 6
```

The actual build directory is `/Users/bep1s/Library/Caches/nfsmw-ios/build`;
compiled shaders are in the sibling cache `shaders` directory. The IPA is
copied into `ios/build/NFSMW.ipa`. CMake/Ninja is used; there is no Xcode project.
Keep uniquely named copies for device tests and record UUID/SHA256, build,
ZIP-integrity and codesign results. Native shader libraries should remain
byte-identical for a CPU-only change. Install/test via LiveContainer; cold
force-quit it when changing restart-only arguments.

## Architecture relevant to optimization

Guest PPC is statically recompiled to C++/ARM64; this is not a general CPU
interpreter. Original engine and Xbox graphics code still build a PM4 command
stream; the SDK command processor preserves ordering, queries, fences and
writebacks. The default renderer snapshots draws and encodes native Metal on
a serial queue; Vulkan rendering is bypassed. Decoded geometry/textures,
constant banks, pooled uploads, residency sets and completion-gated resource
reclamation preserve GPU lifetimes. Bypassing guest/PM4 work requires semantic
equivalence; do not treat the whole guest CPU share as removable overhead.

At 30 FPS the app requests 60 Hz and uses display-locked guest vblank with
sleeping waits. Blindly changing CADisplayLink to 30 breaks the current lock
condition. CPU utilization and GPU milliseconds alone are not energy metrics.

## Current checkpoint — October 18, 2026

- Latest build: **IPA21**, `ios/build/NFSMW-battery-upload-sizing-21.ipa`.
  Host differential checks, final iOS build, ARM64 inspection, ZIP CRC and
  strict deep codesign checks passed. The device correctness run is pending.
  Add only `--nfsmw_native_fused_upload_sizing=true` to the existing tested
  iPad arguments; keep settings fixed, cold-relaunch LiveContainer, do one
  short correctness event and supply its log. Do not stack another source
  change until that result is reviewed. New switch defaults false.
- Latest completed measurement: the two runs in
  `/Users/bep1s/Desktop/debug/18 October 2026/Power_Profiler_1_ipad.trace`, paired
  with `nfsmw_run_1_ipad.log` in the same folder. Both arms have been analyzed;
  no second file or repeat comparison is needed for this pair.
- IPA20, 0.85x, explicit 30 FPS, Battery mode settings, all previous experiments
  and GPU lookup counters ON. Brightness is 34% in both arms, thermals Nominal.
- Ten minutes Low Power Mode ON: estimated whole-device drain **13.612 battery
  percentage points/hour**. Ten minutes OFF: **24.540**. Guarded gameplay gives
  13.856 versus 24.879; a continuing pursuit gives 13.646 versus 24.670.
- Observed saving is about **45% in this comparison**, with modeled CPU impact
  about 61% lower, GPU impact similar. This is not a code-batch attribution or
  proof of the same saving at normal fidelity/60 FPS. CPU operating point is a
  leading explanation; clock/voltage changes were not directly measured.
- CPU time was higher ON, about 91.4% versus 59.2% of one core in guarded
  gameplay, despite lower power. Running samples remained predominantly on P
  cores in both arms. Moving everything to E cores does not explain this result.
- The user recalls all events being Challenge Series pursuits; do not label
  them races from post-event menu names. Workloads evolve and order was ON
  then OFF. Charging tables were empty; cable state was not independently
  verified. Full methodology, limits and numbers are in TECHNICAL.md.
- Flight reference: 95 minutes, battery 75% to 55%, Battery mode/30 FPS plus
  system Low Power Mode, low brightness in a dark cabin, no observed FPS drops.
  No log; exact experimental arguments uncertain. About 12.6 points/hour.
- iPhone event loading is **resolved for now / monitor**, parked by explicit
  user request. No cause or fix was established. Do not resume its isolation
  tests. Offline-only failure has not been reproduced.

## Controls and implementation status

The master `--nfsmw_battery_optimizations=true` defaults ON and rewrites five
individual controls after parsing: cube deduplication, bulk constants,
geometry reclamation, vertex-fetch layout cache and compressible resolves.
To turn those off, set the master false; individual false arguments alone
are overwritten. Group OFF restores historical elevated guest/CP priority
only above 40 FPS; at 30/40 both arms leave it off. The launcher priority option
is retired and `ios_thread_qos` is ignored.

| Independent control | Compiled default | Current evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `nfsmw_native_constant_copies` | true | Guarded guest copy patch; differential host checks, iPad/device checks; no isolated energy claim |
| `nfsmw_native_texture_masks` | true | Conservative shader-slot pruning; large reduction in slot visits, no quality issue reported |
| `nfsmw_native_draw_arena` | true | Per-frame PMR storage; allocation count reduced; GPU/frame ownership preserved |
| `nfsmw_native_render_utility` | false | Render queue largely on E cores; earlier 60 FPS whole-device power unchanged; short iPhone load passed |
| `nfsmw_native_attribute_lookup` | false | Bounded entry front cache, content validation unchanged; iPad correctness passed |
| `nfsmw_native_transform_copies` | false | Guarded scalar transfers, bit-exact differential tests and iPad checks; energy gain unproven |
| `nfsmw_native_lazy_diagnostics` | false | Skips unused normal-frame metadata/labels, preserves snapshots and residency; iPad check passed |
| `nfsmw_native_gpu_lookup_hash` | false | Cache hit rate improved ~57.2% to ~74.0%; device CPU/power gain not established |
| `nfsmw_native_gpu_lookup_stats` | false | Diagnostics only; enable consistently when comparing coverage |
| `nfsmw_native_fused_upload_sizing` | false | IPA21: exact host budget/bounds checks and build passed; synthetic sizing speedup; device check pending |

These are independent switches; clearing Extra Args does not enable the five
older default-false experiments. Most recent iPad profiling had them ON.
Keep test arguments/settings fixed when adding the new flag; don't silently
convert between defaults and the accumulated experimental stack.

## Build references and pending device test

IPA21: `ios/build/NFSMW-battery-upload-sizing-21.ipa`.
UUID `BB547F91-F458-34B1-856F-BED78713E517`; SHA256
`8663dd8a610febf1d4461cfe5898e0b884f4e562f214d11ca4a5af01fe484a9e`.
This is the final build with the budget helpers forced inline. The provisional
build produced during development was replaced before handoff; its UUID
`161393D6-CBA1-38ED-A7D3-29A75747C2A0` identifies the superseded version.

IPA20: `ios/build/NFSMW-battery-gpu-lookup-hash-20.ipa`.
UUID `2CD6D542-84B7-3379-BB26-DAE64A642F64`; SHA256
`311ddbcc7ae6c75c23f3bb57f63e152f0c52757aeb78203d84a9a4c3e6161648`.
Its source change was committed as `da5617b`; later commits through `03da344`
are documentation. See TECHNICAL.md for previous IPA IDs and tests.

Approved next change: combine the renderer's two upload-buffer sizing scans.
Production source: `ios/src/native_renderer.mm`; regression/benchmark fixture:
`tools/native/test_upload_sizing.py`. The fixture extracts production layouts
and both sizing arms and compares against Git reference `03da344`.

The sizing loops account for ~1.54% / 2.06% of active sampled CPU in the latest
ON/OFF profiles; only part is potentially recoverable. The earlier resource-
list assembly proposal is lower priority (main block self only ~0.05–0.07%,
excluding callees). No large energy saving is promised for scan fusion.

The code keeps an independent default-false restart-only switch, the original
two-pass control, exact capacity allowances, and actual upload/resource order.
No shaders, rendering settings, synchronization or SDK source changes.

### October 18 — approved sizing experiment work log

- User approved implementing the combined sizing pass and explicitly requested
  persistent Markdown documentation for cross-session/agent handoff.
- Added a current-state index here and linked it from README and root AGENTS.md /
  CLAUDE.md entry points; detailed prior observations and tests remain in
  TECHNICAL.md rather than being discarded.
- Added the optional fused sizing path and periodic `[native] upload sizing`
  mode identification. One draw traversal ON; original two traversals OFF.
- `python3 tools/native/test_upload_sizing.py` passed **2,011 frames** with
  ASan/UBSan, using extracted production layouts and source reference 03da344.
  Both switch arms match exact original budgets, preserve relevant input,
  bound worst-case aligned uploads, and have the expected traversal counts.
- Initial timing overlapped compilation and was noisy. A warmed benchmark
  then found a slowdown in some synthetic layouts. ARM64 inspection found
  the shared constants-budget lambda outlined into a call per draw in both
  paths. Added always_inline to both budget lambdas and reran checks/build.
- Final `python3 tools/native/test_upload_sizing.py --benchmark` passed at
  -O3. Seven alternating trials, 2,000 iterations, 2,700 synthetic draws/frame:
  fused median 19.212 / 38.127 / 37.955 microseconds versus original
  26.944 / 49.910 / 42.676 at 0% / 20% / 100% fresh geometry. About 11–29%
  improvement for this sizing fixture only; no whole-app/device energy claim.
  Current OFF medians were 26.897 / 52.877 / 43.328 microseconds; no claim of
  identical machine code or universally identical OFF-path timing.
- Final iOS build passed with existing FPSCR/UIScreen warnings. Inspection
  confirms one draw loop ON, two OFF, and no outlined budget helper calls.
  Source after sizing through encoding/ownership up to the summary entry is
  byte-identical to 03da344. ZIP CRC and strict deep codesign passed; all 104
  actual Metal libraries are byte-identical to IPA20 (exclude __MACOSX entries).
- Only native_renderer.mm changed production behavior; the SDK and shader
  sources were not changed. Exact outputs and limits are in TECHNICAL.md.
- Device validation remains pending. Intended next step is one short iPad
  correctness run with the new flag ON, same existing settings/arguments.
  Do not request another long Low Power Mode A/B for this small change.
